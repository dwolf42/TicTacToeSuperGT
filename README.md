3. How I wrote TicTatToeSuperGT:
You maybe also know my first version, called TicTacToeSuper, which I created while following the JetBrains tutorial track on Hyperskill.org to develop a simple TicTacToe game written in Java.</br>
After the suffix ‘Super’ of my previous game, I now added the suffix ‘GT’ to the version, as I pushed myself, the code and everything a byte further. I’ve managed to wrap my head around methods in Java, implemented some nice little ASCII art to make it look better and more fun to play. </br></br>
One of the coolest things for me here is that I was able to put the whole game into an installation EXE file, which not only asks the user where on their drive they want to install the game. It also is capable of putting a shortcut to one’s desktop and, if you wish to, uninstalling the game.
Now the game will tell which players turn it is, prints the whole game board before every turn, tells you how to play, and notifies you about an invalid move made. To match every move I've added a Regex to the code, so only valid moves will be accepted by the game.
 
Have fun with my game and enjoy ;-)
